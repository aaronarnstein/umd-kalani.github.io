    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Cornish game hen with whiskey and cream sauce. is the perfect last-minute get-together dinner meal.
    </p>
    <p>Easy to prepare and half of a hen is the perfect balance between both white and dark meat. I always have two in
        my freezer. My go-to when I do not have time to cook a larger chicken.
        <br>
        I love that you can present a whole, for the hungry crowd, or half of a cornish game hen in a plate and it looks
        fantastic.
        <br>
        The cornish hens can be substituted with a small chicken. Do, however, use the same technique on splitting it.
        You do have to cook a chicken a bit longer. Adjust your timing accordingly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Cornish hen</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 mediun finely sliced shallots</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>a big pinch of herbs of Provence</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <h3>FOR THE CORNISH GAME HEN</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven at 450º and position the rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
        <li>Place a hen, breast side down on a cutting board. Remove the backbone by cutting along both sides with
            shears or a large sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Flip the hen and flatten it by pressing down on the breastbone with your palm. Split the hen in two along
            the breastbone. Repeat with the remaining hen.</li>
        <li>Place on a heavy roasting pan and spread on each half, ¼ of a teaspoon of butter, Herbs de Provence, salt
            and pepper, and a drop of olive oil. Place in the hot oven and cook for 30 to 45 minutes. Poke the hen while
            cooking to release any juices.</li>
        <li>When done, remove from the oven, place the hen in a dish and cover with aluminum foil and let rest.</li>
    </ol>
